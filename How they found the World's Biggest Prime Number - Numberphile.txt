How they found the World's Biggest Prime Number - Numberphile
Jan 21, 2016

2^74,207,281 - 1 is PRIME.

How did the prove it ?

Matt Parker printed it out - about 1490 pages !!!
(double sided, 3 volumes, so ~250 pages per volume = 745 pages double sided)


NOTE:
* This method ONLY works for Mersenne primes !!
* The power of 2 is essential !!!

Excellent video.  So engaging, so informing, so entertaining !  The faces Matt pulls are so funny.  In fact, I would put them in the "Flippin' hilarious !" category.  And him printing the out the largest prime on 745 pages of paper (double sided) is just such a Matt thing to do.  And it is not a waste of paper, he will take these volumes to talks, lectures, meetings, and people will look at them and wonder ...  On a quiet Sunday afternoon, he will probably put his favorite math's journal aside and flick through these volumes and smile.  (Don't worry, I would as well).



************************************************

Lucas Numbers ("like Fibonacci but better"):

1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, 123


Can use these to tell if a number is prime !!!

Eg. Is 5 prime ?

The 5th Lucas number is 11
11 - 1 = 10
10 / 5 = 0
i.e. 10 is a multiple of 5.  5 % 10 = 0 (modulo).

Therefore 5 is a Prime Number !  Probably !


Is 6 Prime ?

The 6th Lucas Number is 18
18 - 1 = 17
6 % 17 = 5

Therefore 6 is NOT Prime !!  Definitely !


The Lucas Test finds numbers that are Definitely NOT Prime !
And we don't have to find its factors !

5 is a Lucas Pseudo Prime - we are not sure if it is prime.
It is very likely to be prime, but not guaranteed.


************************************************

Lucas-Lehmer Numbers / Sequence:

Xn = Xn-1^2 - 2

4, 4^2 - 2 = 14, 14^2 - 2 = 194, 194^2 - 2 = 37634,
1416317954, 2005956546822746114,

4, 14, 194, 37634, 1416317954, 2005956546822746114,


The numbers get very large, very quickly !


Mersenne Primes have the form: 2^n - 1

2^3 - 1 = 7

To check if this is prime using Lucas-Lehmer
we take the power of 2 (3) and subtract 1
(leaving 2) and look at the 2nd number in the list
(14) and see if it is a multiple of the number we are checking (7)
and it is.

So 7 definitely is prime.


2^P - 1 = X

If (P-1)th Lucas-Lehmer is a multiple of X, then
X is 100% Definitely Prime (no ifs, no buts, no maybes).

Or, if (P-1)th Lucas-Lehmer is NOT a multiple of X, then
X is 100% Definitely NOT Prime.

We have not had to check its factors !

Lucas did the calculations by hand and proved:
2^127 - 1 = prime
2^67  - 1 = NOT prime
but he never found a single factor !

2^127 - 1
is the largest prime found by hand.

All primes since then have been found by computer !!!!


************************************************

So to prove:

2^74,207,281 - 1 is PRIME.

They looked at the 74,207,280 th Lucas-Lehmer number and checked if it is a multiple of the
monstrosity 2^74,207,281.

It tooks months of calculations on a super computer.

************************************************

Shortcut

You don't have to store the Lucas-Lehmer numbers exactly, you can store  just the remainders !

A lot less storage !

Example:
2^13 - 1 = 8191	(one of Matt's favorite Mersenne primes)
We need to get the 12 th Lucas-Lehmer number
We only need to find it mod 8191

4, 14, 194, 37634 MOD 8191 = 4870, (4870^2 - 2) MOD 8191 = 3953, 5970, 1857, 36, 1294, 3470, 128, 0

The 12 th term is ZERO = no remainder !!


NOTE:
* This method ONLY works for Mersenne primes !!
* The power of 2 is essential !!!


Mersenne primes
The power (N) has to be a prime for 2^N - 1 is prime.

If N is not prime, 2^N - 1 is NOT prime.
